# Welcome to the Book

This book presents a comprehensive exploration of our research on **The Predicting Pulsed-Laser Deposition SrTiO3 Homoepitaxy Growth Dynamics using High-Speed Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction**, showcasing a collection of nine Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks cover key aspects of the work, including analysis of RHEED metrics, AFM and XRD data, growth mechanisms, and characteristic times. Each chapter provides detailed explanations, visualizations, and insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of the project.

Below is the list of chapters and their focus:
